# PRIMA PROVA MTSS
Managment of an Inventory through *MarkDown* files and the use of **personalized** GitHub Issues.\
Every issue has a collaborator assigned to it and is linked to the Project TrackBoard.

## Personalized Forms Template
We created two personalized Template for the issue: one for adding component or class of component and another for the modification or delete of an existing component.\
The user is guided in the insertion to describe all the information needed for updating the INVENTARIO.
